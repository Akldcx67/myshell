To run the shell you need a compiler I have GCC

```
gcc main.c
./a.out
```
or

```
gcc main.c -o your name
./your name
```
In my shell, basic commands work such as:
cd, ls, cat, pwd, etc.

BUT!

if you type cd, you will not be returned to your home directory, but there will be an error:

```
cd: missing argument
```
